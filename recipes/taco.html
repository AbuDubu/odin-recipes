    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Taco seasoning</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Corn Tortillas</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and cilantro for toppings</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, breaking up clumps with a spatula, until fat renders out and beef begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring constantly until onion is softened and beef is crumbly, about 4 minutes. Drain fat if desired.</li>
        <li>Add desired amount of taco seasoning and cook for 1 minute. Add in tomato paste and water and cook, using a spoon to loosen any browned bits from the pan, and stir until well combined. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully place tortilla in hot oil until it begins to bubble and brown. Flip tortilla and top with 2 tablespoons shredded cheese all over. Next, add about 1/4 cup ground beef mixture on half of the tortilla. Using tongs and a spatula, carefully fold tortilla in half and cook until well browned on both sides. Drain well on paper towels. Repeat with remaining oil, tortillas, taco meat and cheese.</li>
        <li>Carefully open and fill tacos as desired. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
